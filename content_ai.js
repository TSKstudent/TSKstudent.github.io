        "Artificial Intelligence has transitioned from a niche academic field to the backbone of modern digital infrastructure. With the release of Large Language Models, the public perception of AI has shifted from 'tools' to 'collaborators'.",
        "However, the energy consumption required to train these models is staggering. Research suggests that training a single large model can emit as much carbon as five cars in their lifetimes.",
        "The economic landscape is also shifting. While some fear job displacement, others argue that AI will create entirely new categories of employment that we cannot yet imagine."
